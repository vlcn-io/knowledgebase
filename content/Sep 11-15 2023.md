Automigrate errors still exist?
Status code 500 not showing error on user interface?

- auto-prepare insert statements? and re-use?


# Notes

Thoughts:
"Application file format"
- Postgres backend
- SQLite 2 SQLite
- P2P webrtc
- Reactivity / instant interaction
- Text CRDTs?
- Rebase and mutation(s) approach
- Whole db? partial? row level securit?


- [x] crsql_create_crr needs to update TableInfo in ext data such that we do not need to call `ensureUpToDate`
- [ ] Data not replicated after primary key change? Clock records not moved or whatever?
- [ ] auto-migrator fails with trigger changes?
	- [ ] vite starter better refresh by moving root ou. p2p repro fails refresh
	- [ ] Drop tirggers if triggers taken out of schema?

Update table info after migrate. Why? Because we use it for merge to construct pk where lists and the like.

We need to invalidate cached statements for a given table post migrate...
We could also not use the b-tree and instead cache statements in table info as needed.

---

We can statically analyze and pull fragments used by components and combine them into an incremental pipeline and incrementally maintain the view which is the UI.

New trigger:
```
on_insert() {
  let key = SELECT key FROM lookaside WHERE pk_where_list;
  if !key {
	// could reverse and do inser or ignore since insert common
	// case is it not existing
    key = INSERT INTO lookaside VALUES (...) RETURNING key;
    // non-conflict clock set
  } else {
    // conflict clock set
  }
}

on_update() {
  let key = SELECT key FROM lookaside WHERE pk_where_list;
}

on_delete() {

}

// prepared:
// 1. SELECT key FROM lookaside
// 2. INSERT OR IGNORE INTO lookaside VALUES () RETURNING key;
// 3. 
// Causal length can move to lookaside too!
// Hmm.. maybe later since we need sentinel log.
```

SQLite was the perfect embedded database for the last two decades but it's lacking in today's era of collaborative and multiplayer applications.

  

To remedy that, I've extended SQLite over the last year to give it the ability to support multiplayer and collaborative applications. It works by allowing SQLite databases, on different devices, to be merged together in real time.

  

Thanks to help and feedback from https://fly.io, https://expo.dev and https://braid.org I've put together an end to end developer experience around SQLite state synchronization to help anyone build the next Figma, Google Docs or Linear.app without needing to be a distributed systems expert.
