# Blog
- [ ] Recursive query support in differential dataflow -> causal log & crdt substrate in reach

The POC starts from:

# Notes
- Create index on the fly as loading data / when doing table scan
	- this index is available for later criteria change
- First page then continue loading in background
	- updating incremental set
	- writes also update this set
- Simple?
	- Graph
	- Linear operations
	- +1/-1 (add, remove)
