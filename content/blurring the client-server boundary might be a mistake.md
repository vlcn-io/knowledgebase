Thinking along the lines of GraphQL & Relay which may blend it but still make it obvious by requiring fragments to be declared statically.

If we don't let the dev define static queries of data needs we can't load efficiently.

It isn't the blurring that is an issue. Its the not having static access to data needs that is.
