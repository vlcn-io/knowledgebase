		- Potentially we should do some batching to ensure we're doing all reads in a single transaction due to [[IndexedDB slow transactions]]. I.e., we can only do ~100 IDB transactions per second but ~100,000 reads per second within a single IDB transaction. We've done this with the stock [[react integration]].
