# P1
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
	- [x] Cache prepared statements for virtual table insert and read to [improve vtab perf](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/issues/252)
	- [ ] Enable [re-insertion](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/issues/71)
	- [ ] Backup and restore? [gh-145](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/issues/145#issuecomment-1604695054)

	- [ ] File bug report related to:
		- https://github.com/rhashimoto/wa-sqlite/discussions/94#discussioncomment-6316242
- Automigrate
	- [ ] Vite starter automigrate & further testing
---
# P2
- Overtone / [Riffle.systems](https://riffle.systems)
	- [ ] First pass [[Incremental View Maintenance]] for SELECT + JOIN
	- [ ] Lazy reactivity for things like the import service
- Rich Text
	- [ ] Diamond Types integration POC, [potentially Fugue as well](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/issues/65)
- [Turso.tech](https://turso.tech)
	- [x] Turso cr-sqlite and sync to/from the browser over http
		- `turso db create --canary --enable-extensions`
		- `turso db shell crack-pestilence`
---
# P3
- [TinyBase.org](https://tinybase.org)
	- [ ] Review integration
		- Potentially we should do some batching to ensure we're doing all reads in a single transaction due to [[IndexedDB slow transactions]]. I.e., we can only do ~100 IDB transactions per second but ~100,000 reads per second within a single IDB transaction. We've done this with the stock [[react integration]].
		- How is a TinyBase model hydrated to stat? Can we bind a model to a query?
		- Just need to overall understand tinybase better and try to build something with it
- [Framer.com](https://framer.com)
	- [ ] POC for [[converting relations to hierarchies]]
	- [ ] POC for "property table" to model "arbitrary JSON"
- Pre-seed
	- [ ] GTM
	- [ ] 1 year roadmap
	- [ ] Terms
	- [ ] Investor list

# Random notes

	- Does SQLite free memory if binding is not cleared but is overridden?
- Test that binding the same sqlite_value to many statement doesn't err
- update hook and transactions
- unquoted values and impact on js network layers:
	- byte arrays / blobs
