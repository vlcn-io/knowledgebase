I'll finish updating the PR today.

Spent some time catching up on tasks of my own last week but also ran into some virtual scrolling issues when adding windowing to materialite. Not insurmountable, just annoying and time consuming.

I think I'll table those for now and think more about then client driven sync problem. wdyt?
