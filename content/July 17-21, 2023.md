- [x] XCode & SQLite static
	- [ ] Other SQLite iOS thoughts

		- [ ] https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/master/Documentation/CustomSQLiteBuilds.md
- [ ] libsql close hook - https://github.com/libsql/libsql/issues/62#event-9871201225
- [ ] sqld notifications
- [ ] commit sha in cr-sqlite
- [ ] More tests in Rust to replace deleted c tests ^97e528
	- [ ] Many tables merging
	- [ ] Order by consumed
	- [ ] Filter perf, index selection, explain query plan
	- [ ] hypothesis rust?
	- [ ] sqlite memory tests in python tests? valgrind python? o_O even reasonable?
	- [ ] explicit correctness case tests (lamport condition, tied versions, tied values, ...)
	- [ ] only one sentinel on row create even with many pks
	- [ ] pk adjustment stuff work if the user is doing aliased rowids for their pk?
	- [ ] pk adjustment junction edges. pkonly table.
- [ ] re-insertion
- [x] col level trigger, pk adjustment
- [ ] vtab syntax
- [ ] vite-express instead of fork
- [ ] less copies on reading unpacked data
- [ ] prepare query against changes... LRU cache? Capped cache?
- [x] typed sql split
- [ ] IVM
	- [ ] Aphrodite
	- [ ] TypedSQL
	- [ ] R-Tree
- [ ] Frontpage Guide
	- [ ] Automigrator
- [x] [[Beyond CRDTs, The Next Frontier of Local-First]] finalize
- [x] Rust Perf vs C Perf
	- [ ] note that rust conversion is _slightly_ slower in the changes vtab.
		- could be `select 1 limit 1` for delete?
		- could be btree?
		- could be non static methods?
		- could remove missing column compare
- [ ] Newletter..
- [ ] Allocation reduction, wasm boundary speedup
	- [ ] https://github.com/SkipLabs/skdb/blob/main/packages/skdb/src/skdb-browser.ts
- [ ] typed-sql intellisense
	- [ ] https://github.com/segmentio/ts-mysql-plugin

What actually happened:
- expo support
- win issue debug
- rust conversion

# Random Notes
- rust final
	- cross compile final
	- prebuilts
		- droid builds
		- dylib ios
		- static ios
		- swift custom bindings GRDB
- cl final
- roadmap final

[!] The `ios-starter [Debug]` target overrides the `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-ios-starter/Pods-ios-starter.debug.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.

[!] The `ios-starter [Release]` target overrides the `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-ios-starter/Pods-ios-starter.release.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.

Need:
- universal sim
- universal not sim
- universal macos

Should we collect into single rows? Packed rows from crsql changes? Option to toggle on whole row sync? Take the minmax db version of the row.

- custom vtab for full row based replication?
- split up typed-sql
