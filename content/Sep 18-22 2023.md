- [ ] Metadata weight pk finalize
- [ ] JS has cr-sqlite as sub-repo
- [ ] RX Demo

- [ ] update wa-sqlite version
- [ ] db version as col version
Each `col_version` is currently incremented independently. We can instead set it to the current `db_version` to ensure that all values set in the same transaction can also all win together when merging.

This isn't guaranteed since the peer being merged into could be way ahead in db_version overall but have some records behind in db_version.
