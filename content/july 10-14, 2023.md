# Scratch
col-specific-triggers:
- update on pk ... always means delete of the old thing?
- insert on pk ... don't need col specific triggers for pk insert. Only on insert of row to create or increment the CL sentinel.
- delete on pk ... don't need. Only need delete on row to update sentinel.

So we only need col specific triggers for update?
Inserts should overwrite clock values anyway for the new model given we compare on CL.
