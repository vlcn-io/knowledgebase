- migrator bugs
- bootcamp tasks
- db cache re-write + signia?
- 

## Braid x SQLite
- inspiration -- 
	- Resurrect an old project
		- Didn't want to run server
		- Leverage compute and storage on device
		- But.. sync...
	- Lack of cross platform solutions here
	- Embeddable given client centric nature of problems related to state sync
	- Lack of relational solutions
	- Iver paper, James Long preso
	- yjs, braid, automerge, etc.
- Primary use cases
	- Embedded
		- Most deployed software
		- Mobile devs generally use it
	- Edge (litestream, turso)
- Capture reads in CRDT to understand how to order things
