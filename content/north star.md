The embedded database for the application needs of the next three decades.

- Reactive
- Synced
- Offlinable
- RLS
- Tightly integrated into host languages
- Tiered storage
- Mixed Consistency Support

A full developer experience centered around the DB.
- Lang integration (types, query lang?)
- Automigrate
- Post-facto relational?
- 

Eventually evolve into its own DB and graduate from SQLite.
Evolution plan is based around the reactivity system since we'll start to build a query processor at that level.
