- Re-insert
- Compressed metadata
- VTab syntax
- Fugue

- [ ] Expo bindings, prepare statement
- [ ] XCode SQLite docs
- [ ] Frontpage tutorials
- [ ] Re-insertion completion
- [ ] IVM
- [ ] Automigrator robustness
- [ ] More Rust tests to replace C tests
	- [ ] see [[July 17-21, 2023#^97e528]]
	- [ ] filter
	- [ ] causal length invariants
	- [ ] migration
	- [ ] method by method?
- [ ] Compressed clock table format?
	- [ ] Single row w/ all metadata?
	- [ ] [pk, col_clocks, last_db_version, db_versions, last_site_id]
		- [ ] really just fixes: pk redundancy, col name redundancy, site_id redundancy
		- [ ] col_names can go to ints, site_id can go to lookup table for first pass compress
	- [ ] VTab creation
	- [ ] Track col ids through alters so we don't re-use a number that has clock entries for a different column

does_cid_win needs causal length value... since we must check that then check row clocks.
fetching from vtab must return causal length value... so we can have it at insert time
