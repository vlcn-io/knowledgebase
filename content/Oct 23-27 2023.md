# Notes
- Rather than re-compute all, re-compute diff from view to full set?
	- Quick re-compute all via iterators and less copies?
- PersistentSetSource -- do our replace trick on consecutive remove + add calls.
- PersistentTreeView -- not getting a transaction batch?
	- Replace not working if the order by field is modified every edit
		- We can make replace work if we have an `equals` arg
		- orderBy arg should also use primary key at the end otherwise we remove overlapping order by fields
	- Test that we do not allow dupes
- SQLite version of Linear with 100k issues
	- Electric SQL Linearite demo? How solid is that?

- Limit
- Final sink is an array?
- Internal copy of all the things is just a map?
	- Ordered for paging...
- Internal copy of all the things ordered..
- TAO like API?
	- assoc_get for ids
	- obj_get for data
- 


# TODO

- Kanban & IVM & Reduction
- ~~More filters~~
- Doc
- 10 million vlcn linear
- Authorization examples
- WebComponent based DOMSink example? https://jakelazaroff.com/words/web-components-will-outlive-your-javascript-framework/
	- Should be much easier than your vanillajs
- Turso LibSQL Head

- Ref counting
- Fork examples
- Kanban
- Doc
- All the sets pull models..
	- Queues between streams should be iterators not arrays.
- Create indices as we stream? for use on later re-filters?

- Authorization
- 10 million
- Labs rebrand

- http://localhost:3000/d/ATtLW7nOtB
- Use ImmutableJS as SetSource type stuff?
