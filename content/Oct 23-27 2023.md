# Notes
- Rather than re-compute all, re-compute diff from view to full set?
	- Quick re-compute all via iterators and less copies?
- PersistentSetSource -- do our replace trick on consecutive remove + add calls.
- PersistentTreeView -- not getting a transaction batch?
	- Replace not working if the order by field is modified every edit
		- We can make replace work if we have an `equals` arg
		- orderBy arg should also use primary key at the end otherwise we remove overlapping order by fields
	- Test that we do not allow dupes
- SQLite version of Linear with 100k issues
	- Electric SQL Linearite demo? How solid is that?
