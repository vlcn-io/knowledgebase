# Notes
Apps have static queries and dynamic data. Oof.
We can index based on queries rather than data.

TreeQL or whatever tells us the indices to build.
Or `useQuery` as a static thing.

Lookaside change:
1. Triggers become function invocations (unless we can figure out an insert pattern)
	1. Could be, as a first start, 
	   ```sql
	   insert or ignore into __pks values (...);
	   -- need to set a variable... we could use a fn for that.
	   -- need to know if we conflicted...
	   -- actually, we can find that out with `key` since the row will already
	   -- exist in clock table if it'll conflict.
	   -- last_insert_rowid may be incorrect since we could have ignored.
	   -- maybe select first rather than insert or ignore so faster for
	   -- the already existing case
	   select key from __pks where pk_where_list;
	   
	   -- do normal trigger logic
	   ```
