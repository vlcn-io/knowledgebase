# CR-sqlite release notes

v0.16.0-next Release
- We now throw an error if any primary key columns are set to be nullable. 
   - Null primary keys are not allowed in any DB except SQLite.
   - SQLite doesn't enforce uniqueness when a primary key is set to null. I.e., you can have many duplicate rows with a `null` value in the primary key column.
   - This latter problem completely breaks any attempts at merging
- ✅ 10x improvement in perf when migrating `crr` tables
- ❌ 15% reduction in perf when writing to `crr` tables :(
- ✅ 5x reduction in CRDT metadata (at the cost of the above write perf)
- Compilable under `libsql`
- site id is now a required column in `crsql_changes`
- release artifacts are zip files containing the properly named loadable extension. This removes the need for a rename step #385 

Would like:
- Read auth
- Write auth
- Native networking
- Materialite companion
- Compare db version on disk to code running. Bail with useful error.
	- re-insert log spew in db layer?
- Re-enable tests under windowz?


# Materialite Thoughts
- shared / forkable queries defined outside components
- useComponentState type ergonomics
- for updating filters, use computed signal rather than using react reactivity to derive the new query?
-
