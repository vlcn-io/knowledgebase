	- [ ] Linear Vulcan
	- [ ] Linear Materialite Repliear, Vulcan
	- The point here is to understand:
		- Should we care about our own reactivity system? Or just RxQuery + React's reactivity?
		- Remove signal stuff from Meterialite?
		- Which has best devx?
		- 
-  cr-sqlite collab doc service
	- [ ] Native networking
	- [ ] Materialite? Point and range subscriptions?
	- [ ] Accounts and billing
- [ ] Revert site_id tie break
- [ ] Materialite walk through post



- db_version
- authz
- collab service
- native networking?
- windows testing?
- materialite sqlite backend
- rebasing sqlite?
- more rust?

- db version
- authz
- collab service for web
	- faster presence? sync thru storage? rapid commits...

- Strut.io use case
	- Needs materialite! For slides and such
		- Component update should only update specific component and not re-render all the things

What does Strut.io look like under Materialite?
1. querySlides
	1. queryComponents
2. commit component
	1. feed into component stream
	2. only go to relevant component users

Global set of streams to represent tables.
Lazy persist in background to actual table sources.

Binding to objects directly...

-> Update tasks app demo to use multiple sources to represent tables?
-> Lazy bg persist to indexeddb
-> Sorted sources there too?

Materialite video demo:
- Requires fixing scroll so we can zoom to bottom
- Requires fixing selection so we can live edit
