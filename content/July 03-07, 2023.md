# P1
- Fly.io
	- [x] Finish prepared statement caching to [improve vtab perf](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/issues/252)
	- [ ] Finish re-insertion
		- [ ] Version comparison must now take into account causal length
	- [x] Backup and restore thoughts?
	- [x] Speed up `SELECT DISTINCT(db_version) FROM crsql_changes WHERE site_id IS ? AND db_version >= ? AND db_version <= ?;`? https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/vtab_distinct.html , https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/tree/distinct
		- Seems currently untenable without weird hacks. Just push them to use clock tables directly or : https://discord.com/channels/989870439897653248/989870440585494530/1126484059871264768
	- [x] Benchmark insertions against tables with millions of rows

# Random Notes
- Better testing of pack/unpack loop
- **Front page**
- **Vision casting**
- What's next after data sync?
- pre-seed
- tinybase
- **auto-migrate**
- treesql
- overtone perf
- theoretical speed limits of SQLite in browser
- row level security
- inverted db and multi-tenancy
- varint js binary serializer
- public roadmap publication

Would like to start the Rust port... Simplify build, contribution, testing, ...
TreeQL for what? Better React integration.
WebKit bug tho..
  Make a minimal wa-sqlite project that loads the db and auto-execs enough queries to kick off issues.
  Try O2 instead of Oz?
WA-SQLite theoretical limits... / benchmarks for our application load.
