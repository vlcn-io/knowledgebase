# P1
- [ ] CID for compact
	- [ ] rowid fixup?
- [ ] PKs compact against expected results?


# Writing
- [ ] Reactivity from the main thread
	- [ ] 1. Point updates
	- [ ] 2. Updates optimistically when join or where column untouched by mutation
		- [ ] Map from row -> queries using row and project into them
	- [ ] 3. Partially materialized differential dataflow pipeline
	- [ ] 4. Mapping write to impacted queries by indexing queries
	- [ ] 5. In-memory SQLite of data in use by app, full db in worker. Same as partial replication from server to client.
- [ ] Row level security
	- [ ] 1. Callback
	- [ ] 2. Bloom filter of _what has not been sent_ or _what has failed privacy_
		- [ ] thing can now be seen and _definite failed pirvacy_, (bc maybe in not sent set) send it nomatter db version. "failed privacy set" -> "definitely did not fail privacy" & "maybe failed privacy"
- [ ] Partial sync
	- [ ] If query shape changes, full re-sync?
- [ ] Subscription from the backend
	- [ ] Each active session has a set of active partially hydrated differential dataflow pipelines
- [ ] Partially hydrated differential dataflow
	- [ ] Hydrated just from initial query results
		- [ ] How to know when to pull new?
	- [ ] Join index is against actual DB tables not in-memory pipeline index
	- [ ]
