# P1
- [ ] CID for compact
	- [ ] rowid fixup?
- [ ] PKs compact against expected results?
- [ ] Seq bug
	- [ ] New DB version every time we see a different DB version in merge that has not yet been seen.
- [ ] RX Cache for prep statement management and live query re-run
- [ ] JS Normalized Graph Cache
- [ ] TreeSQL compiler, static fragments
- [ ] Authorization
- [ ] Write rejection / authorization
- [ ] VTab syntax
- [ ] Fugue

# P2
- [ ] Split out fract index
- [ ] Split out migrator?
- [ ] 2 phase commit
- [ ] optimistic graph cache. and then inserts
	- [ ] Aggregates... filtered todos...
	- [ ] map rows to diffi-dataflow pipelines?
- [ ] DB Wrapper fixup. Move all to worker once we have sync rx? SAHPool

# Follow Ups
- [ ] DXOS
- [ ] Electric

# Writing
- [ ] Reactivity from the main thread
	- [ ] 1. Point updates
	- [ ] 2. Updates optimistically when join or where column untouched by mutation
		- [ ] Map from row -> queries using row and project into them
	- [ ] 3. Partially materialized differential dataflow pipeline
	- [ ] 4. Mapping write to impacted queries by indexing queries
	- [ ] 5. In-memory SQLite of data in use by app, full db in worker. Same as partial replication from server to client.
- [ ] Row level security
	- [ ] 1. Callback
	- [ ] 2. Bloom filter of _what has not been sent_ or _what has failed privacy_
		- [ ] thing can now be seen and _definite failed pirvacy_, (bc maybe in not sent set) send it nomatter db version. "failed privacy set" -> "definitely did not fail privacy" & "maybe failed privacy"
- [ ] Partial sync
	- [ ] If query shape changes, full re-sync?
- [ ] Subscription from the backend
	- [ ] Each active session has a set of active partially hydrated differential dataflow pipelines
- [ ] Partially hydrated differential dataflow
	- [ ] Hydrated just from initial query results
		- [ ] How to know when to pull new?
	- [ ] Join index is against actual DB tables not in-memory pipeline index

# Notes

- Order-by in differential-dataflow
	- view is ordered
	- received set updates
	- translate into operations against the view
- They need a maintained view so do that piece.
	- Sets -> View
	- Order by is a operation in differential or final operation for view maint? The latter.
